# Bit Manipulation Library
A simple bit manipulation library to learn how to do computation with bits. Does not contain any higher-level computations than bit manipulations. Does not have any external dependancies for computations.
# Restrictions
- No external library access within library functions
- No complex bit manipulation operations; only mathematical operations
- Managing a stream of bits; stream array input stream array output ordered properly
# Features
- Decimal to binary translation
- Bit shifting
- Bit flipping
# Return Values
Functions return 0 upon success. Functions return -1 upon input/output size correlation failure. Functions return 1 upon error.
