# WORK IN PROGRESS :)
# Bit Manipulation Library
A simple bit manipulation library to learn how to do computation with bits. Does not contain any higher-level computations than bit manipulations. Does not have any external dependancies for computations.
# Restrictions
- No external library access within library functions
- No complex bit manipulation operations; only mathematical operations
- Managing a stream of bits; stream array input stream array output ordered properly
# Features
- Translate integer to binary
